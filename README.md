# Image-Classification-with-FNN
A CIFAR-10 classifier using a Feed Forward Neural Network implemented from scratch.
In this project, the implemented FNN classifies the classes "horse" and "cat" from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover this project demontrates how different activation functions, learning rates, initial weights and batch sizes on the test data accuracy and loss of the FNN.
